# CrewAI Experiments

This repository contains a collection of Python notebooks and experiments demonstrating how to build simple yet robust agentic architectures using [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI). These examples serve as practical guides for implementing AI agent systems and will be referenced in an upcoming Medium blog post.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository aims to:
- Demonstrate practical implementations of CrewAI-based agent architectures
- Provide clear, well-documented examples of agent interactions and workflows
- Showcase different use cases and patterns for building AI agent systems
- Serve as a reference for the accompanying Medium blog post

## 📚 Contents

The repository contains Jupyter notebooks that cover various aspects of CrewAI implementation, including:
- Basic agent setup and configuration
- Multi-agent collaboration patterns
- Task delegation and coordination
- Custom agent behaviors and roles
- Real-world use case implementations

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramiyappan/crewAI-experiments.git
cd crewAI-experiments
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open the notebooks in your preferred Jupyter environment and start exploring!

## 📝 Blog Post

An accompanying Medium blog post will be published that provides detailed explanations and insights into the implementations shown in these notebooks. The blog post will cover:
- Core concepts of agentic architectures
- Best practices for implementing CrewAI
- Real-world applications and use cases
- Tips and tricks for building robust agent systems
