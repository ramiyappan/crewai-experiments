      "Based on the insights from the Data Analyst and the user-defined risk tolerance (Medium), I have developed a set of potential trading strategies for AAPL that align with the user's risk tolerance. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Long-Term Investment Strategy: Considering AAPL's stable market presence, diverse product portfolio, and strong financial indicators such as profit margin and return on equity, a long-term investment strategy could be beneficial.

      "\n",
      "3. Options Trading Strategy: With AAPL's wide range of products and global operations, options trading could be an effective strategy.

      "\n",
      "4. Day Trading Strategy: Considering the user's trading preference for Day Trading, a strategy focused on intraday trading of AAPL stock could be implemented.
